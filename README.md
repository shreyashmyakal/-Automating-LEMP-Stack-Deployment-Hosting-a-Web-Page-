#Automating LEMP Stack Deployment & Hosting a Web Page ðŸš€
I recently completed a hands-on project where I automated the LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP) stack installation and hosted a web form on a cloud server. I used Shell Scripting to automate the installation and SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) to transfer files from my local system to the server.

Key Steps in the Project:
âœ… Used SCP to transfer files, including the Shell scripting file (LEMP setup script), from my local machine to the server.
âœ… Executed the Shell Script to automate LEMP installation, which included installing Nginx, MySQL, and PHP (php-mysqlnd).
âœ… Configured MySQL by setting up the root password, creating a database, and a table to store form submissions.
âœ… Deployed Web Form (form.html) for user input and submit.php to insert data into MySQL.
âœ… Tested the Web Application, ensuring that form submissions were successfully stored in MySQL.

This project helped me refine my Linux, automation, cloud deployment, and database management skillsâ€”key areas in AWS DevOps & Cloud Engineering. Looking forward to more cloud-based automation projects! ðŸš€
